## Problem 1

#### Load data and introduce missing values

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.2.0     v purrr   0.3.2
    ## v tibble  2.1.3     v dplyr   0.8.3
    ## v tidyr   1.0.0     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.4.0

    ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

#### Function to fill missing values

``` r
fill_missing = function(vector) {
  if (is.numeric(vector)) {
    v_mean = mean(vector, na.rm=TRUE)
    vector[is.na(vector)] = v_mean
  }
  if (is.character(vector)) {
    vector[is.na(vector)] = "virginica"
  }
  return(vector)
}
```

#### Apply to dataset using map

``` r
iris_with_missing = map_df(iris_with_missing, fill_missing)
iris_with_missing
```

## Problem 2

``` r
files = list.files("./data")
study = data.frame()

get_data = function(file_name) {
  path = paste("./data/", file_name, sep = "")
  subject_data = read_csv(path)
  row = cbind(file_name, subject_data)
  study = rbind(study, row)
}

wide = map_dfr(files, get_data)
